concise list of the key elements:

### crossword.py Classes:
- **Variable**: Represents crossword variables
  - Requires: row (i), column (j), direction, length
  - Directions: ACROSS or DOWN

- **Crossword**: Represents the puzzle
  - Requires: structure_file, words_file
  - Key properties:
    - height, width
    - structure (2D list)
    - words (vocabulary set)
    - variables (Variable objects)
    - overlaps (dictionary of variable intersections)

### generate.py Classes:
- **CrosswordCreator**: Puzzle solver
  - Properties:
    - crossword
    - domains (dictionary of possible words)
  
- **Helper Functions**:
  - print: displays puzzle in terminal
  - save: creates image file
  - letter_grid: generates 2D character list

- **Core Functions** (to be implemented):
  - enforce_node_consistency()
  - ac3()
  - backtrack()

### Data Files:
- Located in `/data` directory
- Types:
  - Structure files (uses _ for blank cells)
  - Word files (one word per line)

# Crossword Puzzle Components

### Variable Class Properties
- `i`: Row number
- `j`: Column number
- `direction`: ACROSS or DOWN constant
- `length`: Word length
- `cells`: List of coordinate tuples (i,j) for each letter

### Crossword Class Properties
- `height`: Puzzle height
- `width`: Puzzle width 
- `structure`: 2D grid (True=blank cell, False=blocked)
- `words`: Set of valid vocabulary words
- `variables`: Set of Variable objects
- `overlaps`: Dictionary mapping variable pairs to overlap positions

### CrosswordCreator Methods
1. **enforce_node_consistency()**
   - Removes words from domains that don't match variable lengths
   - Ensures unary constraints are met

2. **revise(x, y)**
   - Returns True if we removed any values from x's domain
   - Ensures x,y arc consistency for overlapping variables

3. **ac3()**
   - Enforces arc consistency
   - Returns False if no solution possible

4. **backtrack(assignment)**
   - Recursive constraint satisfaction solver
   - Returns complete assignment or None if no solution

### Helper Methods
- `neighbors(variable)`: Returns overlapping variables
- `print(assignment)`: Terminal display
- `save(assignment)`: Creates image file
- `letter_grid(assignment)`: Generates 2D char array

### Data Structures
- `domains`: Dict mapping Variables to possible words
- `assignment`: Dict mapping Variables to assigned words
